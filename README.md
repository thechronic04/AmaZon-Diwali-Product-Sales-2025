##2026 Sales Forecast & Strategic Recommendations
#Focus on High-Demand Categories

Beauty Products are consistently top-performing — expand product variety and introduce combo Diwali gift packs (lipstick + perfume + skincare).

Promote Children’s Books through “Family & Learning Diwali Offers."

Create targeted Diwali campaigns like “Glow & Gadget Fest 2026” focusing on Beauty + Electronics.

##Optimize Payment Method Mix

Since Credit Card usage was the highest, offer exclusive cashback deals and EMI offers to boost conversion rates.
UPI adoption is increasing year over year — ensure smooth UPI payment integration and festival cashback for UPI users.

##Strategy:
Introduce tiered discounts by payment method (e.g., 10% off on Credit Card, 7% off on UPI).

##Improve Delivery Efficiency

High Pending (376M) and Returned (363M) orders indicate a logistics bottleneck.

Focus on inventory forecasting, regional warehouses, and real-time tracking updates.

##Strategy:
Launch “Amazon Diwali Express Delivery” for top 10 states and strengthen return handling through local partners.

##Regional Targeting – Statewise Insights

Sikkim and Rajasthan show strong Diwali shopping enthusiasm.
Consider regional ad campaigns featuring cultural themes and language localization.
States like Meghalaya and Chhattisgarh are emerging markets – focus on free delivery and festival combo packs to boost adoption.

##Strategy:
Use geo-targeted marketing and influencer promotions in Tier 2 & Tier 3 states.
